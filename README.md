Scout is a travel app designed to appeal to a younger crowd. The user logs in through facebook and Scout shows a map with the userâ€™s current location and possible points of interest around them. These include restaurants, night-clubs and attractions. The user is then able to click on a place and see reviews/photos left by other users and also leave a review themselves if they want.
